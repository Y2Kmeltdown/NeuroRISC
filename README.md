# NeuroRISC GitHub Portfolio

This Github is separated into three main components, The RTL design which is written in verilog and details the physical hardware design that is loaded on the FPGA, The bootloading which details the assembler, programmer and memory initialisation for the processor which is all written in python and finally the assembly which is the code that is executed by NeuroRISC at runtime that simulates a spiking neural network which is written in RISC V assembly code.
