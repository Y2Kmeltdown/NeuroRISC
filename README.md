# NeuroRISC GitHub Portfolio

This Github is separated into three main components, The RTL design which is written in verilog and details the physical hardware design that is loaded on the FPGA, The bootloading which details the assembler, programmer and memory initialisation for the processor which is all written in python and finally the assembly which is the code that is executed by NeuroRISC at runtime that simulates a spiking neural network which is written in RISC V assembly code.

## HDL

This section of the code can be found in the HDL directory of the repository. It contains all of the verilog and schematic files used to compile the NeuroRISC processor. All of the work was done on Quartus Prime 18.1 and the design was compiled and run on a Terasic DE10-Nano

### NeuroRISC

The primary core design can be found in the NeuroRisc.bdf and NeuroRisc.v files. This is the file that describes the functional RISC V core that is used to perform the computations. The following files are submodules of this module.

- alu.v
- control_fsm.v
- FivePortMux.v
- imm_gen.v
- instruction_reg.v
- MDU.v
- mem_size.v
- memory_interface.v
- programCounter.v
- registerFile.v
- TwoPortMux.v
- writeback.v

The core is designed to conform to most of the RV32IM specifications excluding CSR instructions which means it can perform all of the base instruction set and the multiply/divide extension of RISC V. The intention of using this design is to provide a small and reprogrammable core that can efficiently emulate a spiking neural network using integer approximation. The design is simple and doesn't deviate from standard design patterns of RISC V cores. More information on the operation of RISC V can be found in the [RISC V Specification](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf).

### Memory and IO Design

To interface the core with the outside world and maintain persistence across cycles the processor needs IO and memory respectively. The design for this uses Harvard architecture or some call modified Von Neumann Architecture where the processor has a separate instruction and data memory. In this design they are separated but are still accessible across the total address space. For simplicity on chip memory is used. In this design it is impossible to read data memory as instructions but it is still possible to read instructions as data. This is achieved by using a two port instruction memory where one port is wired directly to the processor and addressed by the program counter and the other being wired to a memory interface which connects all memory and IO to the processor through data memory. The memory interface takes the address generated by the processor and maps the address to the appropriate memory bank. The instruction memory has a depth of 256 words and a width of 32 bits and the data memory has a depth of 1024 words and a width of 32 bits. To give an example of how the memory interface works if the processor requests data at the address 0 it will receive the very first instruction in instruction memory, and if the processor requests data at the address 256 it will receive the very first word of data in data memory. The IO of the device is very simple for testing purposes and consists of 5 32 bit words which are only used for debugging and to identify that the processor is doing something. These 5 words are accessible via memory mapped IO and are written to and read from the next 5 addresses beyond data memory.

## Bootloader
The supporting software for NeuroRISC consists of a custom built assembler, programmer and memory initialiser.
All of these are written in python. RVassembler.py, RVprogrammer.py and neuronLoader.py can be found in the assembly directory of the repository.
